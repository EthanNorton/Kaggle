# House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This notebook demonstrates how to predict house prices using machine learning techniques. We'll go through the following steps:
- = first time through 
* = a few other times through 

1. Data Loading and Exploration
   - Load training and test datasets
   - Examine data structure and features
   - Check for missing values
   * Go back and explore various models, look at which others have applied to the problem, and how to improve* 

2. Data Preprocessing
   - Handle missing values
   - Convert categorical variables to numerical
   - Select important features

3. Model Building
   - Split data into training and validation sets
   - Train a Random Forest model
   - Evaluate model performance

4. Make Predictions
   - Predict house prices on test data
   - Create submission file

This is a great beginner project to learn:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature engineering
- Machine learning model training
- Model evaluation and prediction
    - Choosing and evaluating various models
